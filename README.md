## Creating a form

- [Nextjs API post request example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/api-routes/pages/index.tsx)
- [How to handle post request in Nextjs stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66739797/how-to-handle-a-post-request-in-next-js/66740097#66740097)
- [SWR - React hooks for data fetching](https://swr.vercel.app/)
- [Connecting Nextjs with Google Sheets](https://dev.to/frasnym/connecting-your-nextjs-mini-project-with-google-spreadsheets-as-database-1o2d)

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

## Playwright

- [Playwright Locator Strictness](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators#strictness)

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Notes

- Please note that before pushing, run vercel build in root directory to verify whether it will build on Vercel.
