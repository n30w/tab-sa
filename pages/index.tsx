            The Republic of South Africa is at a critical juncture in its
            history. The national government has identified the teaching and
            learning of math and science as priorities in the educational needs
            of the country. While millions are no longer legally marginalized by
            the educational system, a massive infusion of material support and
            professional training of teachers and administrators is required,
            quickly, efficiently, and effectively to appropriately serve the
            long-neglected majority population of school children.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2001, Punahou School (Hawaii) and the Cassim Peer Trust (South
            Africa) co-sponsored an international professional development
            project that sent a team of high school math and science teachers to
            South Africa to conduct curriculum-specific workshops with their
            South African colleagues from rural schools. The success of the
            pilot project led to more workshops in the following years, funded
            by grassroots community support in the USA and South Africa. 2016
            will mark the 16th year of the Project.Workshop content is designed
            to meet and exceed the standards of the Curriculum and Assessment
            Policy Statement (CAPS). Without upgrading the skills of educators
            in rural schools in South Africa, students have little hope of
            getting a chance at higher education. More than 100 volunteers from
            the USA have given workshop training to 4500+ South African
            teachers, and 1.5 million students have benefited from their
            teachers' upgraded skills in the past 15 years. And ultimately, US
            students are also the beneficiaries of their own teachers'
            professional development and life changing experiences in South
            Africa.In the words of Mr. Y. Chamda, one of the South African
            administrators of the program,
          </p>
          <p>
            "â€¦to see colleagues from opposite ends of the earth share knowledge
            and culture with such great warmth and caring, is a sight to behold.
            This is an example of international cooperation and global
            understanding at its best."
